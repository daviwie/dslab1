Reflect about your solution!

Summary (per 9 November 2014):
- The assignment has required a great deal of my time and been the cause of many a great headache, however, I am almost finished
- Problems:
	- When running the JUnit Test I receive an error message from an Exception that the address is already in use and cannot be bound
	- My TimerTask extended classes throw NullPointer Exceptions, likely due to a failed network connection of some kind
	- Combined with SEPM and my job, it's been very difficult to find sessions where I can devote multiple hours at one time to the problem
	- There MIGHT be some issues with synchronization in the current state, but I doubt it
- Positives:
	- The program does actually run and doesn't create issues other than these failed TimerTasks and some kind of a network issue
- Moving forward: 
	- On Tuesday (11 November) I will be in the DSLab to try and get some guidance on fixing my solution
- Learned
	- The idea of reading/writing to a socket was difficult at first to comprehend, but is now clear
	- Synchronization is something that requires a great deal of thought to avoid deadlocks, how something like this is done at a larger scale is near impossible to comprehend
	- Communicating with strings was very annoying but turned out to be not much of a problem
	- How to better time manage when learning a new technology, especially something as abstract as distribution and multi-threading
